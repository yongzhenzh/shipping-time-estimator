# Shipping Time Estimator - Implementation Plan

## Goals

Three prioritized goals/versions for the Shipping Time Estimator project:

### v0.1: Core API and Basic Functionality
* Functional REST API that calculates reminder days based on USPS delivery estimates
* Basic integration with USPS API for transit time predictions
* Command-line interface for testing the core functionality
* Simple database schema to store shipping data

### v0.2: Web Interface and Enhanced Features
* Web-based user interface for customers to calculate shipping times
* Enhanced shipping options (standard, priority, express)
* User account functionality to save preferences and addresses
* Improved error handling and edge cases for holidays and weekends

### v0.3: Complete System with Admin Features
* Admin dashboard for system configuration and analytics
* Multi-carrier support (USPS, UPS, FedEx)
* Historical data tracking and improved predictions
* Complete documentation and production deployment
